Finding trends in data about car accidents to learn about the conditions car accidents occur.

Introduction and Hypothesis:
I used a Kaggle dataset about car accidents in the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2015. By observing trends in the data, I hoped to learn about conditions car accidents occur. Before exploring the data, I hypothesized that most accidents happen when dangerous circumstances arise like slippery roads or malfunctioning traffic signals.

Methods:
I used Python to complete this project. Here are the steps I followed:
(1) read the data into Python
(2) selecte specific columns to explore further
(3) clean data by removing missing values and duplicates
(4) create graphs to see trends in the data. I used histograms, pie charts, box charts, bar graphs, and scatterplots
(5) interpret graphs to find trends in the data
(6) formed a conclusion  

Conclusion:
Interpreting the charts for variables related to driving conditions showed most accidents happen under safe and normal circumstances. When pedestrians are involved in a car accident, usually there are no safety features such as a crossing guard or a traffic signal to alert drivers about a pedestrian's presence. Number of casualties is an indicator of the severity of an accident. There is a positive correlation between speed limit and average number of casualties. Also, there is a positive correlation between number of vehicles and average number of casualties.
